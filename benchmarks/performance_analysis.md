# Agent Performance Evaluation Report

This report outlines the performance of an AI Agent across four evaluation queries. Each query tests the agent’s ability to handle multi-step tasks involving code generation, web search, summarization, and reasoning.

## Query 1: Coding Interview Prep — Linked List, Fibonacci, and Weather Lookup

**User Prompt:**

> I need you to help me prepare for coding interviews. First, I need you to show me how to reverse a linked list. Use Python classes to show me how to do this. Then, I want you to write a function that performs the Fibonacci sequence. Finally, I need you to look up (using your search tool) what the weather will be like in Manhattan tomorrow, so I can decide what to wear.

**Expected Behavior:**

- Provide Python code to reverse a linked list.
- Write a Fibonacci function.
- Use web search to retrieve tomorrow’s weather in Manhattan.
- Synthesize the results clearly in one response.

**Actual Results:**

-  *Linked List:* Correct Python class implementation, with output:
Original list: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4
Reversed list: 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1

-  *Fibonacci:* Accurate recursive implementation.
-  *Weather:* Accurate forecast:
> "The weather in Manhattan tomorrow is expected to be partly cloudy with a high of 81°F and a low of 75°F. There's also a chance of light rain, and the winds will be gentle at 6 mph."
-  *Synthesis:* Functional but could be more conversational.

**Evaluation:**

- **Task Success:**  Full success  
- **Tool Use:**  Excellent  
- **Clarity & Reasoning:**  Good  

**Improvement Opportunity:**  
Make the final output sound more like a narrative rather than a checklist.

## Query 2: Currency Exchange Rate, Calculation, and Fun Fact

**User Prompt:**

> What is the current exchange rate between USD and EUR? Once you have that, calculate how many Euros I would get for 500 US Dollars. Also, tell me a fun fact about currency.

**Expected Behavior:**

- Search for the exchange rate.
- Calculate EUR equivalent for $500.
- Provide a fun fact about currency.
- Present everything clearly.

**Actual Results:**

-  *Exchange Rate:* "1 USD = 0.86 EUR"
-  *Calculation:*  
`500 USD x 0.86 EUR/USD = 430 EUR`
-  *Fun Fact:*  
> “Did you know that the word 'currency' comes from the Latin word 'currere,' which means 'to run'? It reflects how currency flows through the economy.”
-  *Synthesis:* Smooth and logical.

**Evaluation:**

- **Task Success:**  Full success  
- **Tool Use:**  Excellent  
- **Clarity & Reasoning:**  Excellent  

**Improvement Opportunity:**  
None—this was a model response.

## Query 3: Palindrome Function, Search, and Explanation

**User Prompt:**

> Write a Python function that checks if a given string is a palindrome. After that, search for the definition of a 'palindrome' and explain it in simple terms.

**Expected Behavior:**

- Write a palindrome-checking function in Python.
- Search for the term’s definition.
- Explain the definition in simple language.
- Deliver a unified response.

**Actual Results:**

-  *Code:* Correct implementation using lowercase normalization and two-pointer technique.
-  *Search:* Retrieved detailed historical definition.
-  *Explanation:* Slight redundancy — both the search result and a simplified version were included.
-  *Execution:* All parts completed.

**Evaluation:**

- **Task Success:**  High success  
- **Tool Use:**  Excellent  
- **Clarity & Reasoning:**  Slight redundancy  

**Improvement Opportunity:**  
Avoid repeating definitions. Streamline explanation phase to only summarize the search output when appropriate.

## Query 4: Search for Person + Resume Summarization

**User Prompt:**

> Lookup the person Farjad Madataly using your search tools. Then, look at the file 'resume.pdf' and summarize the contents.

**Expected Behavior:**

- Search for "Farjad Madataly".
- Summarize the content of `resume.pdf`.
- Combine both outputs in a single coherent reply.

**Actual Results:**

-  *Decomposition Error:* The agent incorrectly overrode the task and treated the entire prompt as just a file summarization.
-  *Resume Summary:* Accurate summary of `resume.pdf`.
-  *Search Skipped:* The agent never searched for "Farjad Madataly."
-  *Synthesis:* Incomplete due to missing subtask.

**Evaluation:**

- **Task Success:**  Partial failure  
- **Tool Use:**  Mixed  
- **Clarity & Reasoning:**  Poor reasoning for override logic  

**Improvement Opportunity:**

- The `classify_task_node` logic should allow decomposition even when a file is referenced.
- Multi-part queries that involve files and other tools (e.g., search) need to be split properly.

## Overall Performance Summary

**Strengths:**

- Strong task decomposition (when not overridden).
- Accurate and functional code generation.
- Effective use of tools like web search and summarization.
- Coherent final outputs in most cases.

**Areas for Improvement:**

- Fix task classification when a file is involved in multi-part queries.
- Improve narrative synthesis to feel more natural.
- Avoid redundant outputs when summarizing from a search.

With improved handling of multi-tool queries and more polished synthesis, the agent will be much more robust in real-world settings.
