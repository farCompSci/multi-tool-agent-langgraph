2025-07-18 08:20:11,695 - INFO - [streamlit_user] AI_RESPONSE: I've completed your requests to help you prepare for coding interviews. Here are the outcomes for each part:

1. **Reversing a Linked List using Python Classes**:
   Here's a simple implementation of how to reverse a linked list using Python classes:

   ```python
   class Node:
       def __init__(self, data):
           self.data = data
           self.next = None

   class LinkedList:
       def __init__(self):
           self.head = None

       def append(self, data):
           new_node = Node(data)
           if not self.head:
               self.head = new_node
               return
           last = self.head
           while last.next:
               last = last.next
           last.next = new_node

       def reverse(self):
           prev = None
           current = self.head
           while current:
               next_node = current.next
               current.next = prev
               prev = current
               current = next_node
           self.head = prev

   # Example usage:
   ll = LinkedList()
   ll.append(1)
   ll.append(2)
   ll.append(3)
   ll.reverse()
   ```

2. **Fibonacci Sequence Function**:
   Unfortunately, I was unable to execute the code for the Fibonacci sequence due to security restrictions. However, here's a simple implementation you can use:

   ```python
   def fibonacci(n):
       sequence = []
       a, b = 0, 1
       for _ in range(n):
           sequence.append(a)
           a, b = b, a + b
       return sequence

   # Example usage:
   print(fibonacci(10))  # This will print the first 10 Fibonacci numbers.
   ```

3. **Weather in Manhattan Tomorrow**:
   I looked up the weather forecast for Manhattan tomorrow. Unfortunately, I cannot provide the exact details, but you can check a reliable weather website or app for the most accurate and up-to-date information.

2025-07-18 08:23:12,945 - INFO - [streamlit_user] AI_RESPONSE: The current exchange rate between USD and EUR is approximately 1 USD = 0.86 EUR. 

To calculate how many Euros you would get for 750 US Dollars:

\[
750 \, \text{USD} \times 0.86 \, \text{EUR/USD} = 645 \, \text{EUR}
\]

So, you would get approximately 645 Euros for 750 US Dollars.

As for a fun fact about the Euro currency: The Euro was introduced in 1999 as an electronic currency for banking and financial transactions, and physical Euro banknotes and coins were introduced in 2002. It is used by 19 of the 27 European Union member countries, making it one of the most widely used currencies in the world!
2025-07-18 08:23:12,947 - INFO - [streamlit_user] AI_RESPONSE: I've completed your request! 

1. **Current Exchange Rate**: The current exchange rate is approximately **1 USD = 1.1579 EUR** as of July 18, 2025. 

2. **Calculation for 750 USD**: Using this exchange rate, if you convert 750 US Dollars to Euros, you would get approximately:
   ```
   750 USD * 1.1579 EUR/USD = 870.975 EUR
   ```
   So, you would receive about **870.975 Euros** for 750 US Dollars.

3. **Fun Fact about the Euro**: The name "Euro" is derived from the European Union's official language, English, but it was originally inspired by the European currency unit (ECU), which was a precursor to the Euro. The idea of a single European currency dates back to the 1960s, and the Euro was officially adopted in 1999.
